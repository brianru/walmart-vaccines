GOAL: Minimize steps to find an available appointment you can keep.

Current UX:
- enter zip code
- select store
- click continue
- select eligibility group
- click confirm
- view warning about eligibility validation docs and click schedule
- first day is selected and appointments, if any, are displayed 
- click to see appointment availability for 2nd day
- click to see appointment availability for 3rd day
- click to see appointment availability for 4th day
- click to see appointment availability for 5th day
- click to see appointment availability for 6th day
- click to see appointment availability for 7th day

Better UX:
A. Browser auto-detects location and displays map and/or list of all supercenters in that state with appointments available that week, sorted by driving distance
- If auto-detect not available declined or inaccurate because of VPN, enter zip code manually
- Filter by day and time
- Click link to proceed to Walmart.com to book the appointment there

Performance is worse in the best case, but that almost never happens (first store you choose has appointment on first day).

There would be some risk in data staleness. How frequently could this refresh?
